# Timeline Builder

**Timeline Builder** transforms your world's history into a beautiful, interactive horizontal scroll. Perfect for tracking campaign arcs, world lore, or character backstories in Foundry VTT.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Visual Storytelling**: Display events with a sleek horizontal layout, complete with images and rich descriptions.
- **Dynamic Effects**: Highlight critical moments using built-in animations like **Glow**, **Pulse**, **Shake**, **Float**, and **Glitch**.
- **Mystery Mode**: Tease your players! Show an event exists on the timeline but obscure the details (Text, Image, or Date) until the time is right.
- **Deep Integration**: Link events directly to **Journal Entries**. Click an event to open the full lore page instantly.
- **Organization**: Manage multiple timelines, categorize events with **Tags**, and filter the view to find exactly what you need.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Access**: Go to the **Notes Layer** (left toolbar) and click the **Timeline** (clock) icon.
2.  **Manage (GM)**: Create timelines, add events, and customize colors/effects in the Manager view.
3.  **Explore**: Players can drag to scroll, click images to enlarge, and filter events by tags.
