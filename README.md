## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Immersive Visualization**: Display events in a sleek, "zig-zag" horizontal layout. Features drag-to-scroll navigation and a built-in lightbox for inspecting maps and artwork.
- **✨ Dynamic Visual Effects**: Make legendary events stand out! Apply animated effects like **Glow**, **Pulse**, **Neon**, **Glitch**, and **Chroma** to specific entries.
- **🛠️ Total Customization**: Style your timeline to match your setting. Choose from different **Line Styles** (Solid, Dashed, Rough/Ink), **Dot Shapes**, and custom colors for every element.
- **🕵️ Mystery Mode**: Tease your players with "Redacted" information. Show that an event occurred but hide the specific date, description, or image until the big reveal.
- **🔗 Deep Integration**: Connect events directly to **Journal Entries**. A single click transports players from the timeline to the full lore page.
- **🏷️ Powerful Organization**: Use **Tags** to categorize events (e.g., "War", "Politics", "Personal") and let players filter the view to see exactly what matters to them.
- **👑 GM Control**: Manage what players see with granular visibility settings. Hide entire timelines or specific events, and use **Broadcast** to show a timeline to all connected players instantly.
